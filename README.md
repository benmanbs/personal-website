# personal-website
The personal website of Benjamin Shai

There are two main components of this site:
1.  the source directory
2.  the builder

## Source directory

The source directory contains all the content for the site with one notable exception: one file is missing.

That file will be generated by the builder

## The builder

The builder takes all the individual contents of blog_posts and turns them into a single javascript file that returns a JSON object that contains all the posts.

Each post has a title attribute, a date posted, and a content.

The generated JSON file is used to hydrate the BlogCollection.
