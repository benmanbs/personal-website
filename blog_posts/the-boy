The Boy

The Boy<br>
<br>
The boy turns to leave for his quest,<br>
His equipment clutched tight to his chest,<br>
(crying)<br>
Knowing this may be the last,<br>
After this, his whole life is the past,<br>
(fearing)<br>
<br>
Mustering up courage he stands straight,<br>
Wipes off tears and faces his fate,<br>
(sighing)<br>
He's aware this quest's insanity,<br>
Embraces his growing depravity,<br>
(leaving)<br>
<br>
For months on the road he's alone,<br>
Making stew from herbs and a bone,<br>
(starving)<br>
Growing thin, his ribs start to show,<br>
And his hair does proceed to grow,<br>
(traveling)<br>
<br>
The boy carries on stoically,<br>
Resigned to his fate with clarity,<br>
(surviving)<br>
Takes each step with greater resolve,<br>
The boy does begin to evolve,<br>
(adapting)<br>
<br>
-<br>
<br>
At this point, dear reader, be warned,<br>
This tale is not to be scorned,<br>
(scoffing)<br>
For the ending is not one of glee,<br>
Of peace, contentment, serenity,<br>
(gasping)<br>
<br>
I'm sad to inform that the quest,<br>
Of the poor boy does get the best,<br>
(defeating)<br>
So as you read this tome,<br>
Be aware that the boy won't go home<br>
(depressing)<br>
<br>
-<br>
<br>
The boy reaches near to his goal,<br>
Can feel it deep in his soul<br>
(nearing)<br>
He begins to perceive from afar,<br>
A barren patch of earth, like a scar,<br>
(decaying)<br>
<br>
He knows it's his final battlefield,<br>
Where his trusty weapon he must wield,<br>
(trembling)<br>
But with nary a look of despair,<br>
He ambles closer with seemingly no care,<br>
(accepting)<br>
<br>
The boy stands up straight to his foe,<br>
Lets none of his turmoil show,<br>
(acknowledging)<br>
With a snarl the two face off,<br>
The worthy adversary does scoff,<br>
(taunting)<br>
<br>
As the battle progresses they see,<br>
The boy's defeat is his naivety,<br>
(damning)<br>
And with one final shout, no more,<br>
The boy is thrown to the floor,<br>
(falling)<br>
<br>
The boy looks in his enemy's eyes,<br>
Sees his death with no form of surprise,<br>
(foreshadowing)<br>
The boy looks deep in his heart,<br>
Thinks back to his fateful start,<br>
(surrendering)<br>
<br>
(preparing)<br>
<br>
(dying)<br>
<br>
As the stranger approaches the town,<br>
Apprehension circles around,<br>
(muttering)<br>
The news of the boy's quest impending,<br>
The questions are never-ending,<br>
(wondering)<br>
<br>
As the stranger draws near they can see,<br>
The scars on his shattered body,<br>
(gossiping)<br>
With great fear of the news they will hear,<br>
Their roaring quiets when he-s near,<br>
(waiting)<br>
<br>
Their mouths are agape as he tells,<br>
A masterful tale of his travels,<br>
(exciting)<br>
A murmur goes through the crowd,<br>
Then someone says it out loud,<br>
(questioning)<br>
<br>
A knowing smile appears on each face,<br>
As they think about this man and his place,<br>
(accepting)<br>
For as you by now understand,<br>
The boy is no more; he's a man,<br>
(succeeding)<br>
<br>
(liberating)<br>
<br>
(living)<br>
<br>
The Man
