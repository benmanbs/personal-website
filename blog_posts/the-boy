The Boy

The Boy

The boy turns to leave for his quest,
His equipment clutched tight to his chest,
(crying)
Knowing this may be the last,
After this, his whole life is the past,
(fearing)

Mustering up courage he stands straight,
Wipes off tears and faces his fate,
(sighing)
He's aware this quest's insanity,
Embraces his growing depravity,
(leaving)

For months on the road he's alone,
Making stew from herbs and a bone,
(starving)
Growing thin, his ribs start to show,
And his hair does proceed to grow,
(traveling)

The boy carries on stoically,
Resigned to his fate with clarity,
(surviving)
Takes each step with greater resolve,
The boy does begin to evolve,
(adapting)

-

At this point, dear reader, be warned,
This tale is not to be scorned,
(scoffing)
For the ending is not one of glee,
Of peace, contentment, serenity,
(gasping)

I'm sad to inform that the quest,
Of the poor boy does get the best,
(defeating)
So as you read this tome,
Be aware that the boy won't go home
(depressing)

-

The boy reaches near to his goal,
Can feel it deep in his soul
(nearing)
He begins to perceive from afar,
A barren patch of earth, like a scar,
(decaying)

He knows it's his final battlefield,
Where his trusty weapon he must wield,
(trembling)
But with nary a look of despair,
He ambles closer with seemingly no care,
(accepting)

The boy stands up straight to his foe,
Lets none of his turmoil show,
(acknowledging)
With a snarl the two face off,
The worthy adversary does scoff,
(taunting)

As the battle progresses they see,
The boy's defeat is his naivety,
(damning)
And with one final shout, no more,
The boy is thrown to the floor,
(falling)

The boy looks in his enemy's eyes,
Sees his death with no form of surprise,
(foreshadowing)
The boy looks deep in his heart,
Thinks back to his fateful start,
(surrendering)

(preparing)

(dying)

As the stranger approaches the town,
Apprehension circles around,
(muttering)
The news of the boy's quest impending,
The questions are never-ending,
(wondering)

As the stranger draws near they can see,
The scars on his shattered body,
(gossiping)
With great fear of the news they will hear,
Their roaring quiets when he-s near,
(waiting)

Their mouths are agape as he tells,
A masterful tale of his travels,
(exciting)
A murmur goes through the crowd,
Then someone says it out loud,
(questioning)

A knowing smile appears on each face,
As they think about this man and his place,
(accepting)
For as you by now understand,
The boy is no more; he's a man,
(succeeding)

(liberating)

(living)
