Only in Israel

5/17/12

I went to Israel in January for a little over two weeks. It seemed like the perfect time to take a vacation; I had just finished school, work didn't start for a while, and my aunt had made Aliyah the previous summer. I hadn't been to Israel since 2008, and it was high time I went and saw my family again.<br>
<br>
In a similar vein, a friend of mine was also planning a trip to Israel prior to beginning his new job. I was naturally excited about this, and tried to plan a time to meet up with him. Unfortunately, due to his work schedule beginning two weeks prior to mine, he was flying out two days after I landed. That only gave us one day of overlap to do anything together.<br>
<br>
Since I was landing on a Tuesday evening, and he was flying out Thursday morning, it seemed the perfect idea to go climb Masada on our one day of jet-lagged overlap. Right?<br>
<br>
I woke up Wednesday morning, bright and early, with plans to meet him in the central bus terminal in Jerusalem at around 9:45. Since my aunt lived in a small city off the side of Jerusalem, this would necessitate taking a bus whose route I was unfamiliar with to get there. Not to mention the fact that I hadn't seen the central bus station in several years, and wasn't certain I would even remember what it looked like. And my aunt wasn't there to point me in the right direction. Definitely an adventure.<br>
<br>
Oh, and did I mention I didn't have a phone? I feel like I neglected that minor detail. No phone. It's funny how dependent we are on our phones. But I digress...<br>
So I head out the door, and as I walk out the front door, I see the bus pulling away from the stop. "Oh well," I think, "I'll just be a couple minutes late." We were planning on taking the 10 AM bus, and I had planned on that bus getting in at 9:40, so that left me with enough time if the buses ran on a consistent 10 minute schedule. A big if. Which I did not get the chance to figure out.<br>
<br>
As I stood there at the bus stop, a car zoomed by me, and then came to a screeching halt. He rolled down his window, and screamed in Hebrew "Where are you headed??"<br>
"The central bus station, in Jerusalem," was my response.<br>
"Oh, I'm not going there," he yelled, and started to speed away. Then he stopped again. This time he yelled in English:<br>
"Where I am headed will be easier for you to get bus to Central Bus Station."<br>
<br>
I wasn't entirely sure where he was headed, but I figured this was one of those moments where the best course of action is to see what happens. Plus, he had a beard, and was wearing a kippah and tallit. What was the worst that could happen?<br>
<br>
I hop in this guy's car, and he speeds off. What followed was one of the most interesting random conversations I had had in quite some time. He was an Australian Jew, who decided to move to Israel after he found the path of Rabbi Nachman, a Hassidic Rabbi who founded the Breslov movement. He now worked as a doctor in a free clinic in Jerusalem, and devoted his spare time to the Chabad style of loving everyone, learning, and trying to get people to spray paint "Na Nach" everywhere.<br>
<br>
Along the way, he asked me questions about my family and upbringing. As I was wearing jeans, a purple shirt, Vibrams, and a cap, I'm assuming he didn't know I was a religious Jew. He kept telling me things like "it's the new month" or "this holiday is coming up, let me tell you all about it." I fear I may have been a bit terse in my insistence on showing I knew what he was talking about. All that aside, it was a lovely conversation, and he was a really nice man for giving me a ride.<br>
<br>
As we neared the end of the ride, he begins rooting around in his glove box.<br>
"My Rabbi gave me a bunch of CDs to give out to people I pick up, and I think he gave me some English ones."<br>
He looked around, but was unable to find any. So he turned around completely, and grabbed a bag out of the back seat. Now, since this is Israel, I wasn't particularly worried; everyone drives like a maniac in Israel. He rummages around in his bag, and finally exclaims, "Ah ha! I knew I had one!"<br>
<br>
From inside his bag, he pulls out a book, The Garden of Emunah. He gives me a ringing endorsement of this book (which I frankly can't imagine him getting through in English, with his terrible grammar and vocabulary) and hands it to me. "I hope you read it, it changes many peoples life. And once you are done with it, pass it on to the next person you see. Maybe give it to your father, it will bring him to be religious."<br>
<br>
I accepted the book, as well as a little book of Rabbi Nachman's favorite prayers, and thanked him for the ride. It actually didn't help me much, as the traffic was pretty bad, and I missed our bus by a good 20 minutes, but we just ended up catching the next bus, so no harm done. And I got to have an only in Israel experience, get a free book (which I still haven't read, shame on me), and show an Australian Breslov man that purple wearing capped bums can still know a thing or two about Judaism.
