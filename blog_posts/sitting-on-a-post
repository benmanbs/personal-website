Sitting on a Post

5/16/12

I've been sitting on a post for the past three days. It's not that I've been particularly busy. Quite the contrary; while I have been doing things and going places, there have been several long spans of time I could have written more. I just couldn't do it.

I'm not certain why I'm having difficulty with this particular post. It's a story that occurred when I was in Israel this part January that I found to be particularly amusing. Well, maybe not amusing, but certainly an entertaining story. I sat there, staring at the empty page, for several hours. Suddenly everything was more interesting. IMing random people, listening to music, reading a book. It was truly perplexing.

I've really been enjoying my new blogging habit. It feels healthy, and right. With the exception of coming up with an idea to write about, which can induce anxiety at times, it's been wholly fulfilling experience.

Which is what made it so much more odd that I have difficulty with this post.

I finally decided to just write a post about my inability to write this post. I needed to get something out there. I had to write something. And since I have no shortage of ideas right now, I wanted to make sure that I posted something about this story. I needed to make sure that I force myself to write it at some point.

All I'm saying is it may not be tomorrow, it may not be for a month or two, but I will eventually post the story.
