The Only Time I Broke Up with Someone (or How I Accidentally Acquired a Girlfriend)

10/25/10

This story includes a particularly embarrassing moment in my life; a time when I made a huge fool out of myself. However, it is humorous, and I need to write more, so in that spirit, I shall share it. If the other person in this story is reading this, I'm sorry. I didn't mean for things to end up like this.<br>
<br>
Early in the beginning of last school year, I met a lovely girl on a Shabbaton. She was smart, interesting, and fun to talk to. However, there was never that spark of chemistry. Since I am socially inept, I proceeded to behave as my normal self, and talked to her a lot, an action now revealed to me to be the famed "flirting". Unaware I was leading this girl on, I continued my every day life, treating her as I do all my female friends. As an aside, perhaps I should clear things up with all my female friends...<br>
<br>
Judging my inaction as shyness, rather than my not liking her, she took it upon herself to ask me out, an action I respect very much. However, she did not do it in a straight forward way. At least, it wasn't straight forward to me. It seemed almost devious, as if to trick me. At the time. In retrospect, I was a blithering idiot.<br>
<br>
I happened to be working at a Jewish book-sale that year. Known as the YU Seforim Sale, it is the largest Jewish book sale nation-wide, bringing in over a million dollars in sales. Oh, and did I mention it's run entirely by YU students? It's very impressive. In a conversation with this girl one day, I offhandedly said, "Oh, you should totally come check out the sale one day. It's rather impressive." This opportunity was to good to pass up, so she pounced. "Yeah, sounds great, I'll come check it out, and we can grab dinner." Just like that I was trapped.<br>
<br>
At the time, I wasn't aware of how deep in I was. However, as the "date" grew closer, she persisted in making subtle little remarks to convince me we were dating. "You're a Mac person? I'm a PC girl, will you still go out with me?" Perhaps that one wasn't too subtle. And yet, I still wasn't certain. I couldn't recall ever expressing interest in dating her. I never asked her out, never told her I liked her. Wasn't that how it was supposed to work?<br>
<br>
On the day we were supposed to meet, it sort of hit me. I was going on a date with a girl I was not interested in. What was I doing to this poor girl? Would my disinterest and eventual ending the relationship shatter her heart into pieces? Was I getting ahead of myself? I began to get frustrated with her, wrongly blaming her for the situation. "She should have known I wasn't interested," I grumbled, knowing full well I only had myself to blame for agreeing to go on a date.<br>
<br>
The date went well enough. We met up, I worked at the sale for a bit while she perused (a word which is mistakenly used for 'quickly glancing over' and which in actuality means 'examined closely. Yes, she perused, 'a bit' was in actuality several hours). We then went for a nice "romantic" dinner at the local shawarma stand. Naturally, we ran into several hundred of mutual friends. "Great," I thought. "More people that will have to be informed of the eventual demise of this relationship."<br>
<br>
Do not delude yourself for a minute into thinking I was the victim here. The girl was most definitely the victim in this story. I was a moron. As the date progressed, I did nothing to dissuade her. I did not once express disinterest in dating. Coward that I am, I carried on in a fashion that would express nothing but a desire to see where it would go. I even went so far as to tell her that I had a lovely time, and that "we should do this again sometime." I dug the trench deeper and deeper, knowing full well that eventually I would have to get out of it, and I didn't have a ladder.<br>
<br>
A week passed. For artistic reasons, another paragraph is necessary, to indicate the passing of time.<br>
<br>
Through out the week, she kept saying we should get together again. Naturally, there was always a reason handy for why that night wouldn't work. Scared to do anything, I hoped that if I ignored the problem, it would go away. However, she noticed. She began to ask if anything was wrong. I needed some time to think. What I really needed was advice. I had never been in a relationship before in my life, and I certainly had no experience ending one. All I knew was that I could NOT blame her for it, saying that I never wanted to date her, and she forced me into it. First of all, that wasn't entirely factual, and second, I knew social etiquette wouldn't let me do that.<br>
<br>
I consulted a friend of mine. She offered many wise words, and offered me a way to end it without blaming anyone, and without (hopefully) hurting her. I resolved to use this tactic as soon as I had the chance. I wanted to do it on the phone, so naturally that had to be arranged.<br>
<br>
Approximately three days after the first date, we had our first phone call. Up until then, we had communicated solely through text messages and IMs. An entirely different problem. That would have been the ideal time to end the relationship. We had had a first date, I could claim it wasn't working out, I could be polite and do it on the phone; seems like the perfect system. But I couldn't. I couldn't bring myself to do it. In my head, I imagined her sobbing hysterically, lonely and forlorn at having lost me. I know, I've got quite the ego and imagination. But I figured that the only way someone would be so pushy would be if they were really obsessed with me (as anyone well should be). I had just dug myself deeper into the hole. This needed to end.<br>
<br>
I decided to take the cowardly route. Since all of our relationship had been through IM, I figured that that was the best medium for me to do it. It also had the added benefit of me not being face to face with her when I did it. I told her I had to talk to her. I said that I just wasn't feeling any chemistry. Not that it was her fault, I just wasn't feeling it. She handled it very well. She asked me when I had come to this conclusion, was I sure, ok, thanks, goodbye. It was at that point I felt it necessary to explain to her that it was not her fault. In the stupidest way possible:<br>
<br>
"I'm not really feeling the relationship, but I still love you as a friend"<br>
<br>
Needless to say, that line got much ridicule. Thus proving I am in no way qualified to break up with someone. Perhaps next time I'll just be succinct; a simple "it's over" will suffice. And will save me from professing my friendship love to a now-ex.
