Take 3 (Third Time's the Charm, I Hope)

10/19/15

I've finally gotten my website back up. It's been in a state of disarray for the better part of a year now.<br>
<br>
Wordpress was hacked twice, and at this point, I've just given up on it. I've written my own blog "framework" (ok really it's not a framework, it's just a static site that uses some fancy JavaScript to make a blog).<br>
<br>
I'm currently in the middle of getting a better workflow written up for publishing the blog, including transferring the domain and hosting over to Amazon Web Services, but at this point I just wanted to put up what I've got.<br>
<br>
Hopefully I'll start writing in this again shortly. I have a couple ideas for posts I would like to write, and I'm hopefully going to continue adding projects to the project page as I work on them.<br>
<br>
Welcome back!
