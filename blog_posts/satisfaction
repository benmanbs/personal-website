Satisfaction

9/8/10

I'm sitting on a train on the way to Brooklyn for Rosh HaShanah. I know it's been a while since I posted here, I read online that in order to be a consistent writer, you have to write a lot of crap, and the jewels will stick out and be popular. Unfortunately, I don't have much crap to write either, hence my infrequent writing. However, I thought I should write an update before the new year.
As I sit here on the train, and reflect on last year, and think about what's coming up this year, one word sticks in my mind: satisfaction. I couldn't think of a better way to explain that, so I wrote a poem. I seem to be writing in the same form a lot recently; deal with it :-).

Satisfaction

Satisfaction is a word,
Usually used this way:
"Satisfaction guaranteed"
A salesman will oft say.

A meal can satisfy a soul,
At least in that regard,
A car or truck, a new sofa,
If its cushions aren't hard.

But I, dear friend, do choose to use,
The word another way,
More similar to contentment,
When happiness does stay.

I like to use this word to say,
"I'm happy with my life,"
And with you by my side, my dear,
I know I'll not feel strife.

So stick with me, through thick and thin,
Be with me for the ride,
For when I am with you, my love,
I'm simply, satisfied.

Shana Tova!
