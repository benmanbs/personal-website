Satisfaction

9/8/10

I'm sitting on a train on the way to Brooklyn for Rosh HaShanah. I know it's been a while since I posted here, I read online that in order to be a consistent writer, you have to write a lot of crap, and the jewels will stick out and be popular. Unfortunately, I don't have much crap to write either, hence my infrequent writing. However, I thought I should write an update before the new year.<br>
As I sit here on the train, and reflect on last year, and think about what's coming up this year, one word sticks in my mind: satisfaction. I couldn't think of a better way to explain that, so I wrote a poem. I seem to be writing in the same form a lot recently; deal with it :-).<br>
<br>
Satisfaction<br>
<br>
Satisfaction is a word,<br>
Usually used this way:<br>
"Satisfaction guaranteed"<br>
A salesman will oft say.<br>
<br>
A meal can satisfy a soul,<br>
At least in that regard,<br>
A car or truck, a new sofa,<br>
If its cushions aren't hard.<br>
<br>
But I, dear friend, do choose to use,<br>
The word another way,<br>
More similar to contentment,<br>
When happiness does stay.<br>
<br>
I like to use this word to say,<br>
"I'm happy with my life,"<br>
And with you by my side, my dear,<br>
I know I'll not feel strife.<br>
<br>
So stick with me, through thick and thin,<br>
Be with me for the ride,<br>
For when I am with you, my love,<br>
I'm simply, satisfied.<br>
<br>
Shana Tova!
