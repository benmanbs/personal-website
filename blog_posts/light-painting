Light Painting

8/10/11

Hello loyal readers!

It has been quite some time since I've posted, and I feel I owe you an explanation. I have a summer job at BAE Systems this summer, and it requires that I be awake at 6:30 in the morning. Between that, and my recent pledge to take a photo a day, I've neglected to post anything here. Hopefully I will change that now onward.

Today, I experimented with light painting photography for the first time. For those of you unfamiliar with light painting, check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_painting" target="_blank">this article</a>.

As per my usual style, I picked a perfect time; it was raining. Not to be dissuaded, I took quite a few self portraits in the rain. I put my camera on a tripod and put an umbrella over it. Here is a picture of my setup:

I set the self-timer to 5 seconds, the exposure to 30 seconds, and the aperture to f-9.
