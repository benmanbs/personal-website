Little Interactions

5/8/12

I'll be the first to admit that there are days when I just want to be left alone. I sit on the subway hidden behind my kindle, reading, and desperately hoping no one will say anything to me. I usually stay away from headphones on the train, because it makes me feel too detached from the world, but I'm not really a part of the world when I'm immersed in a book anyways.<br>
<br>
However, there are days where I ignore the written worlds, and simply observe the actual world around me. I sit on the train, amazed at how few people actually seem to be in the moment, how many of them are trying to escape the very basis of human life: interactions with other human beings.<br>
<br>
As (arguably) the most evolved species on our planet, we boast the most advanced form of communication. However, despite our spoken and written tongues which set us aside from the animals, we still share an unspoken language that is the true foundation of communication. No, I'm not speaking of sign language, unless you count sign language in its basest form: the language of gestures.<br>
<br>
It's pretty amazing what complex conversations you can have with another person without ever opening your mouth. It's these little interactions that add the subtle spice to life, the hint of color to the monochrome canvas of life.<br>
<br>
Confession time again: I am totally the creepy dude that people watches on subway. Come on, who can honestly say that they don't? My current fascination is dreadlocks, but I will totally shamelessly stare at anyone who looks somewhat interesting. Or failing to find interesting looking people, people doing interesting things.<br>
<br>
Just the other day on the train I saw a woman get on the train with her two kids. She plopped them down into seats, one next to me and one across. I offered her my seat to sit next to her daughter (shameless plug, I know :-) ), but she declined. I later realized it was because she wanted to sit next to her son, who was sleepy and clingy. Would that I could have offered two seats, but I am not voluminous enough yet to take up two seats. The younger daughter was taking it so well too. She was younger, yet totally sat there contently while her mother clearly favored the son.<br>
<br>
Midway through the ride, a woman shoved her way across the entire train for no apparent reason. I mean like she pushed everyone aside to walk to the opposite side of the train, to lean against a door down there. She had a far superior door on the original side, so it was quite perplexing. What was even more perplexing is that shortly thereafter a random dude followed suit. Shoved people aside to scurry down to the opposite side of the train, also to lean against a random wall.<br>
<br>
At precisely the same time, the mother across from me and I both turned to see what was superior about the other side of the train. Failing to see any obvious advantage, we turned to each other with similarly perplexed looks on our faces. When we each realized that the other held no answers to this mystery, we both chuckled, and returned to what we were doing.<br>
<br>
You may be asking in your head, "Why are you telling me this story? What's the point? And furthermore, what the heck is up with the missing ending?" Hell, you may even be asking this out loud. I don't know how you interact with your computer. But I do know that it probably won't speak back. And since laziness precludes me from recording myself answering these questions, you'll have to settle for reading the answers, or using one of those notoriously robotic-sounding screen readers.<br>
<br>
You see, there really isn't an ending to this story. A couple stops later, the woman gathered her brood, and exited the train. As she left, I bid her a good day, and she smiled and returned the greeting. I wouldn't be so arrogant to say that I made her day better. And I'm certainly not trying to imply any creepy attachment to a random mother on the train. All I know is that I felt better about myself that day; walked into the office with a wider grin on my face.<br>
<br>
There's something inherently pleasing about interacting with people. Maybe it's just how we're wired as humans. Maybe it's just me and I'm some sort of freak. I'm less inclined to believe the latter though. I'm not that cynical.<br>
<br>
As to what is the point of this anecdote? There isn't really a point. I could take this post as a platform to tell everyone that they should take their heads out of their asses and be more present in life, but I'm not really going for pundit with this blog. Plus, anyone who is inclined to agree with this post and consciously take proactive steps to communicate more probably agreed with me before reading this. You just probably needed a nudge in the right direction.<br>
<br>
I'm certain more stories on this blog will be about random interactions. They are the moments in my day to day life that stick out, and while I have not made a formal commit I have many in mind right now, but I have enough trouble thinking up post ideas without using them all up on one post.<br>
<br>
All I'm trying to say (in a totally non-preachy way) is to experience life. Catch someone's eye, share a laugh, enjoy life's simple pleasures and little interactions.
