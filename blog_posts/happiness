Happiness

5/16/10

As my one reader will know, this past Shabbat was delightful. I had the privilege of meeting several nice, and entertaining people, and got to spend time with one of my favorite people. I came to several realizations over the course of the weekend. Through a conversation with my host, I decided that I need to take more pictures, and I've decided to start posting pictures on this blog too. I'll start with one of my favorite pictures I've taken, but from now on I will only be posting new pictures.

Also, in the course of the past two days, I have been asked for my opinion on the iPhone 4g vs. the HTC Incredible. Here's what I think about this topic. The Incredible is frankly, incredible. It has an eight megapixel camera, an HDMI port, and runs the newest version of Android (froyo? I think it's called). I have actually had the chance to get my hands on one, and it was truly a slick phone. However, in my humble opinion, there is a line between functional and excessive, and this passes into the excessive realm. First of all, do you really need an eight megapixel camera? Five would be sufficient. And even if you posit you do really need an eight megapixel camera on you at all times, because any lower quality just isn't enough, carry a camera with you, because the built in memory in the Incredible is eight gb, if I'm not mistaken, and that's not a whole lot of room for a phone OS, files, music, movies, and full resolution photographs. Which brings me to my next point - the necessity of an HDMI port. An HDMI port implies that you will either use your phone to play movies on your television, or that the camcorder can take full HD video; probably both. Quite frankly, the harddrive space is really an issue here as well, as HD video is huge. A 2 hour movie in HD well compressed can run you 4 gig, so that would be basically all you have room for on your phone. As for the Incredible vs. the new iPhone, the new iPhone specs have not been released yet, so I really can't make a decision.

Another thing I noticed over the weekend; it's very easy to be happy, you just have to be around the right people. There were times I was just perfectly content to sit there, while someone slept, and just enjoy myself. It's reassuring to know that I must not always try to be happy, that the simple things are capable of evoking that emotion too. As long as we've segued into the sappy part of the post, here's another poem:

I'm with you
The relationship is new
New enough that we take pleasure in every little detail
Find happiness in every little thing
With each second we grow closer
With each word we grow fonder
The nuances in your voice
The gestures you make
All endearing
Beautiful

I'm with you
This scene is now familiar
We still enjoy the time together
Now the relationship has grown
Has blossomed into something more than before
There's clearly something here
Something drawing us closer
Your laughter makes me happy
I want nothing more than to entertain you
And you let me

I'm with you
The relationship has progressed further still
We are now content to sit there in silence
Simply enjoying each other's company and presence
I look at you and smile
Your face reflects what mine must look like
Memories can be fleeting
But you are always here

I wake up
Saddened
As the dream slips away
I realize that you are but a figment
Of an overactive imagination
Real life differs from movies
There is no happily ever after
I go through the motions of my every day routine
Empty

I'm with you
Our eyes meet across the crowded room
We are helplessly drawn to each other like moths to light
There is no spark of recognition in your eyes
I die a little inside
This clearly isn't a dream
Yet I wish it were
I wish you would look at me like you used to
When you knew me
When you loved me

I'm with you
The relationship is new
New enough that we take pleasure in every detail
I feel deja vu
And I realize
Your feelings for me will grow
Just as they did in the dreams
I should be cherishing every moment
Privileged enough to experience these first moments twice
I sigh a sigh of contentment
And settle down
To be with you
