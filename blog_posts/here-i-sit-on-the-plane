To Get Things Started

5/12/10

I figured, as I have already covered the topics of religion and love briefly in my first post, that to get things started, I would post a poem I wrote while flying home. Here goes:

Here I sit on the plane
Waiting
Alone
The plane will take off soon
I hear the people behind me talking, laughing
But none of that matters
I sit here anxiously
I'm coming to you

The plane is full
Hustle and bustle, noise, lights
People prepare for their flight
I sit here quietly
I'm coming to you

Now the plane takes off
Lights flicker, the plane rocks and shakes
People are worried, they gasp
Small children are comforted by parents
I sit here calmly
I'm coming to you

We are up in the air
I think of the times with you
The talks, the moments
The good times, the bad
Moments that seemed to last forever
And those which were so fleeting
I sit here anticipating
I'm coming to you

I see you from afar
We run towards each other, embrace
I tell you how I've missed you so
Suddenly, you disintegrate
My arms slide through the air where you were
Frantic, I call your name
Alas, you are gone





Here I lay on the plane
A violent jolt has awoken me from my slumber
Thoughts of losing you rush through my head
It was all a dream
I try to return to sleep, return to you
But my slumber is fleeting
I sit back up, forlorn
I'm coming to you

Hours pass
I begin to envision you reading this
'It's too sappy,' I tell you,
'The guys will never let me live this down'
'Nonsense,' you reply,
'It's perfect'
That's always been good enough for me
I sit here patiently
I'm coming to you

The plane lands uneventfully
As I leave the aircraft, I begin to worry
What if you're not here
What if you were always just another dream
My eyes scan the terminal, hoping, wishing
You are not here...yet
I sit here ever hopeful
I'm coming to you

I see you from afar
We run towards each other, embrace
I tell you how I've missed you so
I wait for you to disappear again
For the world to play another cruel joke on me
For my arms to slide through the space that once held you
A space that will never be as complete again
I must have a look of despair on my face
'Why are you looking at me like that,' you ask, perplexed,
'I'm here'
Reassured, I voice my consent: 'and I'm here too'
I sit here smiling
I've come to you
