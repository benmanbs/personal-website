To Get Things Started

5/12/10

I figured, as I have already covered the topics of religion and love briefly in my first post, that to get things started, I would post a poem I wrote while flying home. Here goes:<br>
<br>
Here I sit on the plane<br>
Waiting<br>
Alone<br>
The plane will take off soon<br>
I hear the people behind me talking, laughing<br>
But none of that matters<br>
I sit here anxiously<br>
I'm coming to you<br>
<br>
The plane is full<br>
Hustle and bustle, noise, lights<br>
People prepare for their flight<br>
I sit here quietly<br>
I'm coming to you<br>
<br>
Now the plane takes off<br>
Lights flicker, the plane rocks and shakes<br>
People are worried, they gasp<br>
Small children are comforted by parents<br>
I sit here calmly<br>
I'm coming to you<br>
<br>
We are up in the air<br>
I think of the times with you<br>
The talks, the moments<br>
The good times, the bad<br>
Moments that seemed to last forever<br>
And those which were so fleeting<br>
I sit here anticipating<br>
I'm coming to you<br>
<br>
I see you from afar<br>
We run towards each other, embrace<br>
I tell you how I've missed you so<br>
Suddenly, you disintegrate<br>
My arms slide through the air where you were<br>
Frantic, I call your name<br>
Alas, you are gone<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here I lay on the plane<br>
A violent jolt has awoken me from my slumber<br>
Thoughts of losing you rush through my head<br>
It was all a dream<br>
I try to return to sleep, return to you<br>
But my slumber is fleeting<br>
I sit back up, forlorn<br>
I'm coming to you<br>
<br>
Hours pass<br>
I begin to envision you reading this<br>
'It's too sappy,' I tell you,<br>
'The guys will never let me live this down'<br>
'Nonsense,' you reply,<br>
'It's perfect'<br>
That's always been good enough for me<br>
I sit here patiently<br>
I'm coming to you<br>
<br>
The plane lands uneventfully<br>
As I leave the aircraft, I begin to worry<br>
What if you're not here<br>
What if you were always just another dream<br>
My eyes scan the terminal, hoping, wishing<br>
You are not here...yet<br>
I sit here ever hopeful<br>
I'm coming to you<br>
<br>
I see you from afar<br>
We run towards each other, embrace<br>
I tell you how I've missed you so<br>
I wait for you to disappear again<br>
For the world to play another cruel joke on me<br>
For my arms to slide through the space that once held you<br>
A space that will never be as complete again<br>
I must have a look of despair on my face<br>
'Why are you looking at me like that,' you ask, perplexed,<br>
'I'm here'<br>
Reassured, I voice my consent: 'and I'm here too'<br>
I sit here smiling<br>
I've come to you
