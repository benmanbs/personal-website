The Train

1/14/2013

The other day I stood on the train watching a little girl and her dad interact. He was bringing her to school, and then clearly going straight to work. As they sat there, discussing trains, and the mechanics of taking trains places, the little girl said something that almost made me cry. 

"Do you think Mommy is riding the train up in heaven?" The man looked sad, as he answered, "yes, baby. I think she is."

One thing I've noticed atheists can't get enough of is the concept of intellectual honesty. Am I being intellectually honest with myself if I believe in god knowing there's no true proof? Can a scientist truly know something for which there is no empirical evidence?

As a math/logic person, I've always felt a little swayed by these arguments. Where else in my life do I blindly believe something for which the evidence is tenuous? This seems like an emotional decision, and since when do we allow emotion to play a part in science?

I'm not sure there is an answer. And you know what? I'm ok with that. Belief is an emotional decision. There's no tangible evidence for why I'm feeling happy, or moody. Sure, we can speculate, but what scientist would be satisfied with speculation? Maybe I'm fine with knowing belief is an emotional response. 

Maybe one day, when I look down into the eyes of a little girl who has lost someone she loved, I'll be able to reassure her with truth and conviction that her beloved isn't gone forever, that they're in a better place and they'll meet again. Maybe that's worth the price of dishonesty.
