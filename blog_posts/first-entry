First Entry

I have been toying with writing a blog for many a fortnight. My roommates and friends have discussed it in the past, and they have encouraged me to do so. However, my contention was always that I don't have what to say that is of interest to other people. Then, earlier this eve, we had a bit of a debate about religion and love, amongst other things, and it dawned upon me that I have a very linear and logical way of thinking. "This could be a springboard for my blog!" I exclaimed. Well, I didn't exclaim it, as this realization was done in my head, and my roommates would have looked at me funny had I said that out loud. In any event, I have decided to just create a blog, and see what comes out of it. It will probably contain my random opinions on things religious and computer related, as well as some poetry, and whatever else my fantastical brain decides is worth publishing. Enjoy!
