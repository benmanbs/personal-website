Website Back Up

7/1/12

And we are officially back in business! Here's the short story.<br>
<br>
My website was hacked by some random spanish speaking dude. Not sure why he targeted me, I don't get a whole lot of page views or anything. I believe it was due to a vulnerability in one of the plugins or themes I was using. I have since removed all plugins and themes (except for my current one), and attempted to beef up security a bit.<br>
<br>
I spent the better part of the past three hours getting all my old posts entered in the system, with the correct dates of writing. I think we should be good now. If you spot anything wrong with the site, any of the posts, anything, shoot me an email. <br>
<br>
From here on out I will be able to write all the ideas that have been stewing. Keep your eyes out for updates!
