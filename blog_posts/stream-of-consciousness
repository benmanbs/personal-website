Stream of Consciousness

5/5/12

I suck at writing a stream of consciousness.<br>
<br>
Whenever I first sit down to write one, my thoughts are initially plagued with "what am I thinking right now? How about now? I should really think about something... How about now? Anything? Bueller...?" This segment of the writing usually ends up very self-referential and unimaginative.<br>
<br>
I then usually pick a topic, because my ability to think on command is very limited. I'll decide to think about something, consciously. I don't really want to do that. Ideally I would love to just shut off my brain and type. A straight connection from thought to keyboard, completely bypassing any mental facilities. Invariably, this never happens.<br>
<br>
I begin to censor my thoughts. "Stream of consciousness... stream... urine!" My mind beams at me, proud of succeeding in its task to follow a thought like a breadcrumb trail in a fairy tale. But I know my mind. I know that following that line of thinking will be disastrous. "No, brain. That's not appropriate. We can't go on talking about piss in our creative writing. We'll end up with a full page of potty talk!"<br>
<br>
So that thought line is squelched, leaving me in the predicament I was in before.<br>
<br>
It is usually at this point that I become frustrated by the whole process. This naturally results in the section I fondly call "teenage angst". "This is stupid. I hate writing my feelings. I never think of anything anyways. Snarly pouty grumble grumble."<br>
<br>
You might think that this would be a good thing. "At least you're writing out your feelings", you might reason. You would be completely correct. Unfortunately, my mind realizes this too, plopping me back at the beginning of my endless loop with a "hey, you're doing it! You're not thinking about what to write, you're-damn it! Lost it again!!"<br>
<br>
In a way, I turn the whole process into that Internet game, The Game (which, by the way, you just lost). The Game is a game which is played by not playing it. Huh? Basically, if you think about The Game, you lose the game. Winning The Game is a hopeless activity, because there is no game end; just because you're not thinking about it now doesn't not mean that eventually you won't remember and think about it. And when you do think about it? You lose.<br>
<br>
For me, stream of consciousness writing becomes an exercise in futility. Since I'm actively trying to write my thoughts, my thoughts become about writing them, a meta situation that never works out.<br>
<br>
Which leads to the eventual conclusion of every attempt: me giving up. I look at the piece of paper which has nothing on it but thoughts about thinking, thoughts about hating thinking, and piss.<br>
<br>
In a sense, that sums up my life.
