Undecided

5/7/12

Starting off writing a blog post without knowing what you're going to talk about is something like I would imagine it feels like to be an undeclared major in college. In the spirit of full honesty, I was never undeclared. But for the sake of this analogy, I will play pretend.<br>
<br>
In a sense, it's liberating. You feel very relaxed. There's no limits. Anything is possible. The white blank page looms before you like the infinite creative workplace, invigorating you with its lack of rules, and opportunity for anything. You can ramble around, pursue your interests, and make people annoyed by your carefree nature.<br>
<br>
What's your plan for the future? Who cares! I'm still young, I can do what I want. I'm only going to get this opportunity during the time of my life! Ok, so maybe not a perfect analogy, most blogs are mutable. But bear with me here, I don't really have anything to write about...<br>
<br>
On the other hand, it can be quite overwhelming. The white blank page that seemed so open, so fraught with possibility, now seems like it's a huge blank space that must get filled. How in the world am I going to fill all this space without any content? Is this a joke? More than halfway through writing about pure gibberish, and I'm out of ideas!<br>
<br>
Like a English essay written on the night before its due, your post lacks the organization and structure that would help you get the required number of pages. You're on page 2 out of 6, and you've already used up all your ideas. Oh well, I guess I should just add filler BS. Can I talk more about the author's background? A simple copy from Wikipedia should be good for a paragraph or two, right?<br>
<br>
Probably the best comparison lies in the fact that both of them have no ending. When you're dealing with a post with no specific subject matter, it's hard to find a logical stopping point. Similarly, eventually you have to declare a major. You have to take that plunge. Otherwise, you'll end up at college for your whole life, like Pierce Hawthorne.<br>
<br>
I am still undecided about how I feel about these types of posts. Frankly, I started this post without any concrete ideas for what to write, and it seems to have gone OK. Then again, my go to method for post writing seems to be writing something absurdly meta about writing, so maybe this isn't the best practice for me...
