Pretending

8/27/2012

I feel like a large portion of our lives is spent pretending. Whether it has to do with work, friends, or even how we view and present ourselves. 

At work, we pretend to be experts at what we do. We pretend that we are certain that what we're doing is the correct way to do it. You would think this is isolated to a more nebulous field, like computer programming, where there are many "right" ways to do things, but you'd be wrong (<a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/semmelweis" target="_blank">http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/semmelweis</a>). 

We pretend to be confident. We project airs that say, "I'm worth spending time with". "I feel good about myself". "I have things of value to say". 

Sometimes I think self confidence is a charade. Because even when you can fully logically admit to yourself that you are indeed attractive or smart, there's still that irrational part of your brain that refuses to believe it. 

Sometimes I think that even the most attractive confident-sounding men are pretending. In an amusing stroke of irony (or maybe it's not irony, call me Alanis), I've had a blog post in the works for quite a while entitled "Self Confidence". The amusing/ironic part? The contents of the post are the following: . That's right, the file is empty. 

Please don't read this blog post as a cry for help, or fishing for compliments. I know full well my value and worth. I know what traits of mine are worthwhile, and which need work. But again, despite the complete logical understanding, the ability to look at myself through an outsiders eyes and see the good in me, I still can't convince the corner of my brain that handles the emotions. 

I've heard that if you pretend something long enough, it becomes true. That if you keep acting confident, you will become confident. As if you can somehow fool yourself into believing your fantasy. 

Heck, for all I know, maybe it's true. Maybe I just haven't been pretending hard enough.
