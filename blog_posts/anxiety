Anxiety

5/21/12

I'm not a nervous dude by nature. At least that's what I like to tell myself. I usually view myself as pretty chilled out and calm. Reserved. However, there are moments in life when I am just struck by a crippling anxiety. The sad thing is that it's usually not for a legitimate reason. I get worked up all over nothing.<br>
<br>
These are a few of the things that give me anxiety. You decide if they're legitimate or not:<br>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>Coming up with a blog post (it's been too long since I wrote a self referential post, had to throw this in). Whenever I sit down to write a blog post, or even begin thinking about it, I get all this anxiety about not having a post idea. Never mind the fact that nearly half my blog posts have been meaningless rants about not having an idea. Never mind the fact that I can count the readers of this blog on one hand. Never mind the fact that my self imposed schedule has already been hopelessly shattered, and not writing wouldn't be the end of the world. It just worries the heck out of me.</li>
	<li>Having to pass wind in the presence of company. I'm sure this is a common concern (though slightly less common would be my usage of the phrase "pass wind"). The ability to flatulate (which apparently is not accepted by google chrome's spell check?) silently is a skill which always seems to elude me while around other people.</li>
	<li>Showers. This may sound like an odd one, but hear me out. I get real anxious when it gets late at night, and one of my roommates decides to take a shower. Sure, I may be doing something. Sure I may not be planning to go to sleep for another hour. Doesn't matter. I get this feeling that I may decide all of a sudden that sleep is imperative that moment, and their being in the shower prevents me from preforming my pre-bed ablutions. I am forced to remain awake against my will, waiting for my toothbrush, which is being held captive by a showering fiend. This usually results in my brushing my teeth several hours before I go to bed in fear that the bathroom will become occupado.</li>
	<li>Clothing. I'm fairly certain this one is unique to me, in that I'm nuts. I have this fear of wearing an article of clothing that I really like in a time that doesn't take full advantage of it. So I will refrain from wearing a shirt for weeks and week, because I'm scared that when the day arrives that I really want to wear it, it will be dirty, and all hope will be lost. Naturally, this often results in me just not wearing certain pieces of clothing, and realizing several months later that in my efforts to save these for the best time possible, I end up not using them at all. It's a pretty crazy thing to worry about.</li>
	<li>Sending text messages (and to a lesser degree, IMs). This one is probably the worst. It really gets me freaking out like you wouldn't believe. If I send a text message to someone, and it contains either: a) a question, b) something mildly edgy, c) a joke that could be misinterpreted, d) basically anything of value, then the longer I don't hear back from the person, the more worried I get that I said something horribly wrong. That I just ruined a relationship, or gravely offended someone, or made a new mortal enemy. I freak out that they are looking at their phone thinking, "what the f*** is wrong with this dude? What did he just say??" It's a struggle every second to not send another text remedying the mistake in the first one, or assuring the person that I am an idiot and didn't intend whatever misinterpretation they may have found. It's really awful.</li>
</ul>
<br>
So yeah, those are the things that make me nuts. Would be nice to know if anyone else feels the same way about any of those.<br>
