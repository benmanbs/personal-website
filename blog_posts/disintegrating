Disintegrating

7/13/12

Disintegrating into nothing
Falling into the abyss
I stretch out my hand
Twist impossibly
Through a Herculean effort
And am caught by you

Coldness has sunken its hungry claws into me
I feel my grip slipping
I call out your name
Deafness bestows its blessing upon you
I go unnoticed

The end is near

We make eye contact
I look for a hint of concern in your eyes
Wait for you to mouth words to me
Over the din of my impossibly loud heartbeat
Words like "hang on"
"You're going to make it"
Words like "I love you"
Nothing is forthcoming

We both watch in slow motion
My precarious grip looses
Slips

I tumble backwards
Reflecting on all the times you've let me go
They seem less important
Dwarfed by my current predicament
Still
I should have seen this coming
It's your nature

I feel no sadness
Just acceptance

Disintegrating into nothing
Falling into the abyss
I stretch out my hand
Twist impossibly
And touch nothing
Grab no one
I'm alone

The abyss swallows me up
And just like that
It's as if it never happened
