Disintegrating

7/13/12

Disintegrating into nothing<br>
Falling into the abyss<br>
I stretch out my hand<br>
Twist impossibly<br>
Through a Herculean effort<br>
And am caught by you<br>
<br>
Coldness has sunken its hungry claws into me<br>
I feel my grip slipping<br>
I call out your name<br>
Deafness bestows its blessing upon you<br>
I go unnoticed<br>
<br>
The end is near<br>
<br>
We make eye contact<br>
I look for a hint of concern in your eyes<br>
Wait for you to mouth words to me<br>
Over the din of my impossibly loud heartbeat<br>
Words like "hang on"<br>
"You're going to make it"<br>
Words like "I love you"<br>
Nothing is forthcoming<br>
<br>
We both watch in slow motion<br>
My precarious grip looses<br>
Slips<br>
<br>
I tumble backwards<br>
Reflecting on all the times you've let me go<br>
They seem less important<br>
Dwarfed by my current predicament<br>
Still<br>
I should have seen this coming<br>
It's your nature<br>
<br>
I feel no sadness<br>
Just acceptance<br>
<br>
Disintegrating into nothing<br>
Falling into the abyss<br>
I stretch out my hand<br>
Twist impossibly<br>
And touch nothing<br>
Grab no one<br>
I'm alone<br>
<br>
The abyss swallows me up<br>
And just like that<br>
It's as if it never happened
