Weekend

7/11/10

As I suspected, the weekend was a time for much excitement. First of all, I had a jam packed friday, cooking for shabbat. The excitement of the day was the lack of hot water in the shower, the word 'cold' cannot even begin to describe what that shower was like. Then, I had a couple friends over for dinner and conversation, the topics spanning far and wide, some a bit too risque for my taste. Following a refreshing night's sleep, I lunched with a group of people who all hailed from the same city; a city I'm not from. I'm sure they enjoyed the opportunity to reminisce, it just didn't quite make me nostalgic. I then went for a nice walk Motzei Shabbat, and had a nice time today as well.<br>

Just something that we discussed from shabbat that kind of stuck with me. We were discussing the idea of shabbat, and how there is a machloket about whether electricity is prohibited because it's making fire, or because its finishing touches, or simply not in the spirit of shabbat. This led us to discuss morality in the Torah (don't ask how...I'm not quite sure myself). My roommate contended that there is no such thing as morality in the Torah, because if you offer someone a reward for doing something, morality never comes into play, as you are no longer saying 'do this, it makes you a good person' rather 'do this, I'll give you a cookie'. However, I am of the opinion that Torah does promote morality, as one of the message of the Torah is 'K'doshim Tihiyu' - be holy. I understand this to mean that the Torah is by no means a complete set of rules, and anything not contained within it's covers is therefore fair game. Rather, the Torah is a framework for life, and by setting the rules in it that it does, it shows us how we should behave by some examples.
