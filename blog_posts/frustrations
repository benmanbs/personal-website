Frustrations

12/15/10

I have not posted in a while, as is my usual custom, but I must post now to simply rant. I have been terribly busy this semester thusfar, between the Seforim Sale and YCDS (by the way, the play was amazing! And the cast gifts were too!!), I barely had time to do schoolwork. However, as things have cleared up recently, I figured I would rant on two things that occurred the past day or so that really ticked me off.<br>
<br>
Firstly, my bed collapsed. "What does that mean?" you may ask. Excellent question. My bed frame is similar in design to this one:<img class="alignnone" title="IKEA Bed" src="http://www.beddingidea.biz/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/ikea-malm-bed-frame-twin-k75rzltg.jpg" alt="" width="500" /><br>
<br>
As you can clearly see from the image, there is a metal bar that runs the length of the bed, which holds up all the slats, and in turn, the mattress. However, the one distinction between my bed and the one pictured, is that instead of being made out of hearty wood, as this one appears to be, mine is made from particle board. That means that all of my weight is resting on two screws into particle board. That seems like a bad idea to me, and I'm no engineer. Anyways, it is these two holes with screws into them that gave way last night, causing my bed to implode like a deflated bounce-house:<br>

Obviously, the guy in this image is an accurate representation of my reaction, as I was on the bed when this transpired. So yeah, this crappy IKEA bedframe was cheap, but I could have been hurt, and it just collapsed! Not OK! I think I may call them and demand a new one as I could have died or something. I could have died, right?<br>
<br>
Second thing that totally frustrated me was the was the iPhone handles email. I have had an iPhone for 2 years now, and I basically love the device. It's a really slick piece of technology, and I use it all the time. I have not had any problems with it that bugged the heck out of me....until yesterday. Like most people, I use gmail. Possibly unlike most people, I have gmail receive mail for many different email accounts. I must have upwards of 7 or 8 accounts that all are through gmail, and I am able to send a receive from different accounts all through gmail. Slick, huh? A feature I love about gmail is the ability to have all replies to emails be from the address the email was sent to. That means that gmail will automatically reply to an email sent to burrito.lemon.cake@gmail.com  from that same address, even though I'm checking it through my main foods.that.shouldnt.be.mixed@gmail.com account. Awesome. I can even different signatures based on accounts. So if I reply from burrito.lemon.cake, my signature could be:<br>
<div class="indent">Benjamin Shai<br>
Burrito Lemon Cake Enthusiast</div><br>
while an email from applesauce.lamb.roast would be signed:<br>
<div class="indent">Benjamin Shai<br>
Lamb Roast + Applesauce = &lt;3!!!</div><br>
Clearly a reason to love gmail.<br>
<br>
However, for some reason, the iPhone does not support this function. That means every email I receive to my gmail account, regardless of which email address it was sent to, will be replied from my main gmail account, which is terribly unprofessional. I researched ways to fix this, and it appeared that there were none. "That's absurd," I exclaimed, so I kept looking. And looking. And looking. Finally, I found one solution, which is pretty stupid. I had to add every email address I send from as a separate account. Then, I had to set all of those to manually receive email instead of fetching them, so that they will never download email from the server. Then, I would have to manually set which email I want to reply from every time I send an email. Stupid. Apple, if you hear me, please fix this! Until then, at least my emails look professional....
