The Train (A Poem)

8/29/2012

The train rumbles past at an alarming clip,<br>
As the man is beginning to muse,<br>
"If I say nothing, I'm back where I started,<br>
So what do I have to lose?"<br>
<br>
The issue is evident, the meaning is clear,<br>
The choice, a no brainer, it's true,<br>
But self confidence does not listen to reason,<br>
So nothing, the man proceeds to do. <br>
<br>
Defeated, disheartened, discouraged indeed,<br>
The man casts his gaze to the train,<br>
It's still rumbles by, blazing towards a new home,<br>
Stopped by neither sleet nor rain. <br>
<br>
"My life," says the man, "is like the trains journey,<br>
Headed on to the unknown,<br>
And just like the train, it passes real fast,<br>
(the actual speed is unknown)"<br>
<br>
"I should live life the fullest, grab every chance,<br>
Fear not the consequence,<br>
For in the end, when all's said and done,<br>
What matters is happy events."<br>
<br>
With strengthened resolve, the man straightens up,<br>
Steers himself towards his course,<br>
And as the train leaves, he mimics its actions,<br>
And lives a full life, no remorse.
