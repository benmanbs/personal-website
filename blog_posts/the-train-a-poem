The Train (A Poem)

8/29/2012

The train rumbles past at an alarming clip,
As the man is beginning to muse,
"If I say nothing, I'm back where I started,
So what do I have to lose?"

The issue is evident, the meaning is clear,
The choice, a no brainer, it's true,
But self confidence does not listen to reason,
So nothing, the man proceeds to do. 

Defeated, disheartened, discouraged indeed,
The man casts his gaze to the train,
It's still rumbles by, blazing towards a new home,
Stopped by neither sleet nor rain. 

"My life," says the man, "is like the trains journey,
Headed on to the unknown,
And just like the train, it passes real fast,
(the actual speed is unknown)"

"I should live life the fullest, grab every chance,
Fear not the consequence,
For in the end, when all's said and done,
What matters is happy events."

With strengthened resolve, the man straightens up,
Steers himself towards his course,
And as the train leaves, he mimics its actions,
And lives a full life, no remorse.
