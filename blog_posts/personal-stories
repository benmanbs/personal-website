Personal Stories

7/19/12

I'm still a bit torn on the topic of writing personal stories or feelings on this blog. I know I've done so in the past, but they were mostly anonymous and innocuous. I'm talking about real things. Feelings on concepts that matter, or people (that matter or don't matter).

This blog was supposed to act as a journal. As a way for me to write how I'm feeling freely. I guess the concept of a blog may not be best for that goal. The very fact that there's potential for people to read it, however few they may be, is enough of a motivator for my writing to be more entertaining and less expressing. 

On top of that, there's the fact that any feelings or stories I had about specific people would likely be read by those people. I was already in the somewhat awkward situation where my coworker mentioned she read my posts about her. Imagine if I had said anything offensive.

I know not which way I'll go on this matter. I will likely continue writing whatever feels right to me, consequences be damned.
