Programming

7/6/12

I don't write very many posts about programming on this blog. I had this realization today, as I read through some posts on hacker news. In particular, I recall reading a post someone had written which has a preface saying something to the tune of, "this is day 12 of the write every day in a month challenge". I remember thinking, "how is it that this individual is writing so many things about specific programming topics?"<br>
<br>
I consider myself a programmer by trade. I love the challenges, the puzzles, the nerd humor. I read tech blogs and articles all the time. I love staying current on new technologies or languages, and I always admired people who were confident enough in their programming abilities that they were able to write opinionated pieces about algorithms or nuances of a specific language. So why don't I ever do that?<br>
<br>
I think this is a complicated question, but certainly one worth answering, so I will try my best to do so.<br>
<br>
Yes, I am a programmer, but the work that I do is not really innovative in any way. I have problems and I get them solved. I'm not developing new methods to do things, or using fancy new languages to fit my use case. I'm not inventing new algorithms, developing better security procedures, or contributing to open source. I am constricted by the constraints of my job, and the technologies used by my project. And I don't find them particularly compelling to write about.<br>
<br>
Also, due to the possessive nature of large corporations, I'm unable to write in my blog at work, and I'm unable to view my code at home. This heavily restricts the amount of writing I can do about specific problems. And since the code is company property, I can't really post any of it anyways.<br>
<br>
Probably the most compelling reason I don't write about programming topics in this blog is because writing is something I do for fun. I'm aware that "hard core programmers" will look down on me for saying this, but after coming home from 8-9 hours programming at work, the only things code related that I want to do are read more tech news, or work on my own projects. I enjoy writing, and I use it as an outlet, but I have no interest in writing about dry programming topics. Heck, I'm not even interested in writing about juicy interesting programming topics. Let me unwind, and rave like a lunatic about random topics, or spout off cheesy poetry.<br>
<br>
I love being a computer programmer, and I wouldn't trade it for the world. Just let me have other hobbies too.
