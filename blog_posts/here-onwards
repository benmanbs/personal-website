Here Onward

10/21/10

The post before this marks the last post I had written in my old blog. As of now, the blog on this site is fully functional. Woohoo! Just a few more things left to implement, and this site will be ready for the world's eyes. I am now deleting my old blog, hopefully I didn't forget anything... As you can see, not really much of a prolific writing career. I've said this several times, but laziness will always beat out motivation to have a blog, especially when I don't really have that much to say anyways.<br>
<br>
In any event, this will be the spot for all future blog post, feel free to RSS this site if for some strange reason you feel that I could actually write something worth reading, and that it has to be read the minute I post it, and not a moment later.<br>
<br>
For now, keep an eye out for any future blog posts, as well as any new features that are currently under construction.<br>
