Suspicions

5/14/10

It appears my suspicions were correct; I don't have what to say that is interesting. In the past two days, I have been watching everything transpire, and I really don't have anything enlightening to offer. Just going to throw out a couple of things that have happened recently: a friend of mine had a terrible day, which led to a quite interesting conversation about religion, I relayed this conversation to someone else and depressed them, and had a conversation with my little brother regarding the merits of the new iPhone vs. the HTC Incredible. All routine stuff. This Shabbat is looking exciting though, I will be sure to update based on that....right? Ah well, here's another poem:

a lone mitten sits on the curb
bereft and forgotten

it had a mate once
long ago
alas
time plays cruel tricks

once it was able to sustain
to warm
to protect

now it sits alone
wallowing in the sorrow that has become its existence
hoping
but never quite achieving
oneness

a lone mitten sits on the curb
the wind rushes by
carrying tales of a better time
reminiscence

the frailty of life is apparent
the cold that comes with loss now a dull ache
instead of the searing pain it once were

yearning
to warm again
to bring happiness and light to someone else
doomed

a lone mitten sits on the curb
it is removed from its perch
examined

an exclamation is uttered
a journey is undertaken

reunited again with its mate
the mitten feels whole
warming
protecting

this is life
this is completion

happy at last
for its the ability to give
rather than the ability to receive
that marks ones devotion
