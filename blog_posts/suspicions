Suspicions

5/14/10

It appears my suspicions were correct; I don't have what to say that is interesting. In the past two days, I have been watching everything transpire, and I really don't have anything enlightening to offer. Just going to throw out a couple of things that have happened recently: a friend of mine had a terrible day, which led to a quite interesting conversation about religion, I relayed this conversation to someone else and depressed them, and had a conversation with my little brother regarding the merits of the new iPhone vs. the HTC Incredible. All routine stuff. This Shabbat is looking exciting though, I will be sure to update based on that....right? Ah well, here's another poem:<br>
<br>
a lone mitten sits on the curb<br>
bereft and forgotten<br>
<br>
it had a mate once<br>
long ago<br>
alas<br>
time plays cruel tricks<br>
<br>
once it was able to sustain<br>
to warm<br>
to protect<br>
<br>
now it sits alone<br>
wallowing in the sorrow that has become its existence<br>
hoping<br>
but never quite achieving<br>
oneness<br>
<br>
a lone mitten sits on the curb<br>
the wind rushes by<br>
carrying tales of a better time<br>
reminiscence<br>
<br>
the frailty of life is apparent<br>
the cold that comes with loss now a dull ache<br>
instead of the searing pain it once were<br>
<br>
yearning<br>
to warm again<br>
to bring happiness and light to someone else<br>
doomed<br>
<br>
a lone mitten sits on the curb<br>
it is removed from its perch<br>
examined<br>
<br>
an exclamation is uttered<br>
a journey is undertaken<br>
<br>
reunited again with its mate<br>
the mitten feels whole<br>
warming<br>
protecting<br>
<br>
this is life<br>
this is completion<br>
<br>
happy at last<br>
for its the ability to give<br>
rather than the ability to receive<br>
that marks ones devotion
