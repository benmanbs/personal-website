Startups

5/6/12

Everyone seems so obsessed with startups these days. I'm not entirely sure if it's the idea or just the word that gets them off, but it's all people talk about. "Didja hear about Instagram selling for a billion? Startups are where it's at, man"<br>
<br>
Whatever happened to the good old days? People had an idea for a product, and they just made it. None of this idea campaigning, no seed round investors and critics sitting around the round table with King Graham commenting on every aspect of the idea. No. People had an idea for a product and they made it. Showed people the prototype. Improved on the design, went through multiple iterations. And then they marketed it and sold it.<br>
<br>
Maybe that's still happening these days. I don't know. It's all obscured by a veil of buzz words. It's like Moby Dick; everyone just wants the big haul.<br>
<br>
This startup culture is bound to fail eventually. It's just a group of people who think they can market a mediocre idea and become an overnight millionaire. News flash: people have been looking for get rich quick schemes forever, and this is just another one. No one wants to hear about your next Facebook which lets people's pets connect. Enough chatter about ideas that never come to fruition.<br>
<br>
You know what I think people should do instead? Instead of all this jibber jabber, sit down, come up with a product that makes people's lives better, and just make it. Contribute to open source. Or sell it, I don't really care. I'll pay money for a product that makes my life better.<br>
<br>
This is why I have mad props for the dudes behind Pebble. They sat down, conceptualized a cool useful product, and made it. They iterated on the idea, made it the best they could, and started marketing it. None of this buzz nonsense. No "profitability" or "bubble bursting". No investors, or critics, or anything unnecessary. They said "who will pay money for this product?" and people responded.<br>
<br>
Bottom line: stop talking and start doing. I don't have any ideas for life changing products, so you don't see me selling invisible unmade products, assuring you that this will be huge, and it's worth it to work for nothing because equity will be worth millions in a few months. Don't startup for the sake of starting up. Show me a product, or get me interested in an idea, and then we'll talk.
